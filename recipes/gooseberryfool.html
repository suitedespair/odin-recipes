        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>500g/1lb 4oz gooseberries, topped and tailed</li>
                    <li>100g/3½oz caster sugar/li>
                    <li>3 tbsp elderflower cordial</li>
                    <li>200g/7oz double cream/li>
                    <li>100ml/3½fl oz thick Greek-style yoghurt or crème fraîche</li>
                    <li>fresh mint sprigs, to decorate (optional)/li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put the gooseberries, sugar and cordial in a saucepan. Cook on a high heat until the sugar has dissolved and the fruit is soft. 
                        Remove from the heat and reserve a quarter of the cooked gooseberries.</li>
                    <li>Blend the remaining cooked gooseberries in a blender or food processor, then sieve to remove the skins. Set aside to cool.</li>
                    <li>Whisk the cream in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Fold in the yoghurt and fold in the 
                        blended gooseberries. Divide between six glasses.</li>
                    <li>Leave the glasses in the fridge for at least 2 hours, to allow the fool to thicken.</li>
                    <li>To serve, spoon the remaining gooseberries over the top of the fool and decorate with the mint, if using. Serve with honey melts.</li>
                 </ol>
