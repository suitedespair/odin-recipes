                    <li>200ml/7fl oz passata</li>
                    <li>500ml/17fl oz vegetable stock</li>
                    <li>100ml/3½fl oz single cream or low-fat crème fraîche</li>
                    <li>splash dry sherry</li>
                    <li>crusty bread and butter, to serve</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and cook the onion for 5-6 minutes over a gentle heat until almost softened but not browned. 
                        Add the garlic, celery, carrots, bay leaf and thyme and cook for a further 6-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, making sure the 
                        vegetables don't stick to the base of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and sugar and season well with salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes, then stir in the passata and 
                        vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook for 35-40 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender.</li>
                    <li>Remove the bay leaf and thyme, then blend the soup in a liquidizer or food processor. This will probably have to be done in two 
                        batches. Pour the soup into a clean saucepan, passing it through a sieve if you want it really smooth. Stir in the cream, a splash 
                        of sherry and extra seasoning if required.</li>
                    <li>Pour into large mugs or bowls and serve with fresh crusty buttered bread.</li>
                 </ol>
